# Libadwaita Border Enhancement

A set of tweaks to make buttons easier to distinguish by drawing borders around buttons

#### What it does
- Adds borders to regular buttons
- Does not add borders to flat buttons on non-active/ non-hovered state
- Adds borders on hovered buttons including the flat buttons
- Adds subtle shadows on clicked buttons
- Adds faint borders to the sidebar (the sidebar on the left)
- Tweaked headerbar buttons

Q: Does this modify the background color of buttons?

A: No, that would be a chore and would prevent me form touching grass
