# Libadwaita Border Enhancement

A set of tweaks to make buttons easier to distinguish by drawing borders around buttons.\
This might improve the accessibility of the UI for some people.

#### What it does
- Draws borders regular buttons
- Excludes flat buttons on non-active/ non-hovered state from the enhancement
- Adds borders for hovered buttons
- Adds subtle shadows and increases border visibility for clicked buttons
- Adds faint borders to the sidebar row (the sidebar on the left)
- Tweaked headerbar buttons

### QA

Q: Does this modify the background color of buttons?\
A: No, that would be a really big task to execute.

Q: Why does this tweak exist?\
A: My aging eyes did not like the low constrast buttons.
